<p>Hello Survivors,</p> <p><strong>The Crossplay Update is now available, expanding the matchmaking pool across both PC and Xbox One</strong>.

<p>I haven't tried the new content yet, but wanted to give a huge Kudo's to the Saber team for continuing updates to this fantastic game.<br /> For me it's The Best FPS game I've played, and I've been around since Castle Wolfenstein on MS-Dos.. gawd them were huge pixels.<br /> The movement mechanics is perfect, the Gun-Fu and loot inventory is perfect, the stories lines and characters are perfect, the graphics are out of this world. With that beer virus that's got everyone in a frenzy this is definitely great practice for what's to come.<br /> Can't wait to jump back into Horde mode, that was one of my fav's.<br /> I don't want this quarantine to ever end, I just want to &quot;Slice n dice b$%##$%&quot;.<br /> Cheers.</p>

<p><a class="plugin-mentions-user plugin-mentions-a" href="https://forums.focus-home.com/uid/72950">@Jellyfoosh</a><br /> Great stuff but 2 issues</p> <ol> <li> <p>Double Barrel Shotgun desperately needs rebalancing. It is a weapon no one wants to use. Low Ammo, Long Reload, Short Range, Low damage and has an extremely high spawn chance. The gun needs a significant damage buff + Penetration to really make it meaningful.</p> </li> <li> <p>PS4 Crossplay when?<br /> The only thing I was excited about was going to play with my friend on PS4 - only to find out its Xbox Only. Crossplay was already delayed since November.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Thanks in advance for the update.</p>

<p>I was hoping for a Double barrel variant and Casual 6, but loving the new variants so far! Classic BR full auto is nasty and I actually go for the machine pistol now with the full auto. I only found the objectives from the bombers but adds a new objective definitely spices things up! The skins are awesome and as always thank you guys for another awesome update! I was hoping to see another trailer for the update, been missing those awesome intro videos. Looking forward to seeing the update in spring with the new city!</p>

<p>Having to download the entire 16GB for a minor update on Xbox is ridiculous. We're clearly downloading data we already have and it's BS. Devs really need to learn the difference between updating and completely replacing the entire game install with the current version. I could care less about crossplay with PC, it'll more than likely bring hackers with it, and this will take me 16 hours to download.</p>

<p>Thanks for the update. <img src="https://forums.focus-home.com/plugins/nodebb-plugin-emoji/emoji/emoji-one/1f642.png?v=1he1g3bdp93" class="not-responsive emoji emoji-emoji-one emoji--slightly_smiling_face" title=":)" alt="🙂" /></p> <p>Two issues observed:</p> <ol> <li> <p>One of the previous patches mentions reducing price of <strong>Equipment Supplies</strong> from 30 credits to 25 credits in Horde Mode, yet it still costs 30 credits.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bomber</strong> when defused drops container with virus in Horde Mode which player can pick up, but it shouldn't have according to Patch Notes. It could be additional difficulty, but then there should be a reward as well. If I'm correct a leaking container applies &quot;infected&quot; effect (same as from Injector zombie) in cyclic time intervals.</p> </li> </ol>

<p>Thank you so much for the Oksana outfit I love it. I wanted something purple &amp; blue for her that didnt have a hat and you nailed it for me! The Extra Large Med Kit on her back is a little much though, it's actually very visually distracting at times. Maybe redo the model some and reduce the bag size by 25-50%. <em>Also maybe recolor the bag itself to match the scarf color</em></p> <p>Still though hands down my favorite outfit for my fav character.</p>
